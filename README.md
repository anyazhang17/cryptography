# cryptography
The program encodes or decodes cryptographic messages hidden in binary image files using steganography. 
Steganography is the process of hiding a message within another object such as an image, audio file, movie, text, network streaming, etc. 
Unlike other cryptographic methods that conceals the contents of a secret message, steganography also conceals the fact that a message is communicated. 
A least-significant-bit technique of steganography is used. The least significant bit technique is a technique in which the last bit of each pixel
in the image file is modified and replaced with the secret message data bit.
There are two additional techniques: Caesar Cypher and Huffman Codes. A Caesar cypher is a simple cryptographic technique used to encode text, 
whereas Huffman Codes is a simple compression algorithm used to compress text messages.
